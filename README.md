Utilities for working with Augur data. 
1. [Tod Do Group Repo Linter](./repo_linter/)
2. [Augur Data Collection Evaluation Queries](./augur_monitor/)
3. [Cleaning up Bad Data](./more_cowbell/)`+`

And many more to come!


`+` This script is only necessary on instances of Augur that began collecting data before May, 2024. That does not mean it's required, however it does mean that new instances will not have to worry about this at all. Duplicate repos were only introduced in very specific circumstances where GitHub org addition and repo movement to new URL's were not addressed in concert.
