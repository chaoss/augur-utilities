# Augur Monitor 

1. Make sure you have the latest version of geckodriver installed for the interactive HTML version of the `visualize_data_range.py` script. Just sayin'. 
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` should cover all the scripts herein. 
3. `postgresql.conf` is here so if my database server crashes I have a copy of it. No. Just kidding. Its really to let YOU know how I tune my postgresql instance. Of course I would not stash critical infrastructure in the subfolder of a repo like this. 
4. `lock_check.sql` stands alone for lock checking. 
5. Would you like fries with that?
6. `docs/` folder is generated by the `visualize_data_range.py` script. You might want to empty the placeholders first.
