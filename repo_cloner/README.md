# Clone a bunch of Github Repositories
Sometimes you just want to clone a list of repositories and do your own analysis of the commit logs. Augur is not necessary for *everything*. 

There are two scripts who perform the same function: Cloning a list of repositories as specified in a text file, `repos.txt`. 

1. `cloner.go` is the "Go" version. To run, its simply `go run cloner.go`. 
2. `cloner.py` is the Python version. To run, `python cloner.py` if you have created a python3 virtual environment. Otherwise, its `python3 cloner.py`. No external libraries are required.
